A JupyterLab extension to record provenance and credit information in support of FAIR principles.

## User story

IPCC authors create a Jupyter notebook to generate a figure to be included in an IPCC report. This notebook loads this JupyterLab extension that lets authors include provenance information (software used, datasets used), as well as credit information (citable DOIs for papers, software and datasets). 

This information is either stored within the notebook's metadata, or in a sidecar file. The credit information can later be used to create a Complex Citation Object (CCO), a citation embedding multiple citations. By citing the CCO in IPCC reports, providers of input data and software would get credit for their work. 

Note that the CCO is in development and no standard has been agreed yet. 

Desiderata:

* Provenance information should be machine-readable and ideally compatible with provenance metadata generated by the [CMIP7 Rapid Evaluation Framework](https://wcrp-cmip.org/cmip-phases/cmip7/rapid-evaluation-framework/).
* Authors should be able to review and edit the provenance and credit metadata manually using a simple GUI within the Jupyter interface.
* Authors should be able to export the credit information (maybe as bibtex while CCO is being defined).

## Ideas

* For Python kernels, the `import` command could be overloaded to store explicit imports and their version;
* For each imported package, fetch the CITATION.cff from the source repo and create a citation;
* Inspect the compute environment to get a detailed listing of installed packages;


## Status

I've tried to create a vanilla extension and then copy over the logic from the metadata-form example from jupyterlab-extension-examples, but nothing works. I could get things to work by running the jupyterlab-extension-examples on its own, but that's the extent of my progress. 


## Requirements

- JupyterLab >= 4.0.0

## Install

To install the extension, execute:

```bash
pip install jupyter-ext-provenance
```

## Uninstall

To remove the extension, execute:

```bash
pip uninstall jupyter-ext-provenance
```

## Contributing

### Development install

Note: You will need NodeJS to build the extension package.

The `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of
[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use
`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.

```bash
# Clone the repo to your local environment
# Change directory to the jupyter-ext-provenance directory
# Install package in development mode
pip install -e "."
# Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLab
jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite
# Rebuild extension Typescript source after making changes
jlpm build
```

You can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab at the same time in different terminals to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension.

```bash
# Watch the source directory in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when needed
jlpm watch
# Run JupyterLab in another terminal
jupyter lab
```

With the watch command running, every saved change will immediately be built locally and available in your running JupyterLab. Refresh JupyterLab to load the change in your browser (you may need to wait several seconds for the extension to be rebuilt).

By default, the `jlpm build` command generates the source maps for this extension to make it easier to debug using the browser dev tools. To also generate source maps for the JupyterLab core extensions, you can run the following command:

```bash
jupyter lab build --minimize=False
```

### Development uninstall

```bash
pip uninstall jupyter-ext-provenance
```

In development mode, you will also need to remove the symlink created by `jupyter labextension develop`
command. To find its location, you can run `jupyter labextension list` to figure out where the `labextensions`
folder is located. Then you can remove the symlink named `provenance` within that folder.

### Testing the extension

#### Frontend tests

This extension is using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for JavaScript code testing.

To execute them, execute:

```sh
jlpm
jlpm test
```

#### Integration tests

This extension uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) for the integration tests (aka user level tests).
More precisely, the JupyterLab helper [Galata](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/tree/master/galata) is used to handle testing the extension in JupyterLab.

More information are provided within the [ui-tests](./ui-tests/README.md) README.

### Packaging the extension

See [RELEASE](RELEASE.md)
